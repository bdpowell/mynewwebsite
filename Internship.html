                    <p>I started wokring with the Keweenaw Community Foundation in April of 2016.</p>
                    <p>I have always been interested in nonprofit work. KCF, for me, was the perfect fit because not only do I get to be a part of a great team, but I also become more aware of a great community. As a student, this is so important to me because—even though I am far from home—it helps to keep me grounded.</p>
                    <p>During my time with KCF, I completed various design and content projects such as, a new brochure, informational handouts for their Planned Giving Initiative, web page content for the different funds pages on the website, and web banners for the homepage of the website. </p>

                <h4>Internship</h4>
                <p>This was the first project I completed for KCF. Their previous brochure was a quad-fold that was very text heavy. The goal was to make it short and sweet while also providing the information people would need at a glance.</p>

              <h4>Internship</h4>
                <p>This was the first 'real' application I had with Adobe Photoshop. The website needs updating every four months or so and I was assigned to make new web banners that reflect what is currently going on at the Foundation. I had a lot of fun with this project because it helped me become more familiar with how important layers are in Photoshop.</p>

                <p>For this project, I helped to compile content; images, logos, tag lines, and other information, about the various funds that the KCF supports. This was done in an effort to make the information more assessable to patrons who wish to donate to local non-profits.</p>

                <h4>Internship</h4>
                <p>This was the most in depth project that I worked on for the KCF. I developed all of the content first, and then designed the pages based on the website. It was a fun challenge because (at the time) I didn't really know how community foundations worked. As the project came together my understanding got stronger and my drafts developed into the final product.</p>
